This repo provides a Typescript implementation of [dust2](https://mrc-ide.github.io/dust2/) in R and closely follows its structure. 

This implementation allows dust systems to be run in the browser.

Models should be implemented as "generators", and one of the System classes used to spin up and run the system.
